    <string name="directionsBody">"In this game, you roll three dice and are given a score based on your roll.\n
If all three dice are the same value (a Trifecta!), your score will increase by that value times 100.\n
\t\t(i.e. You roll triple 3\'s, you get 300 points).\n
If two dice are the same value, your score will increase by 50 points.\n
If none of the dice match, you receive no points.\n
You can clear your current score or your saved Hi-Score by opening the menu and pressing \'New Game\' or \'Clear Hi-Score\', respectively.\n
Click Play when you are ready! Good luck!"</string>
